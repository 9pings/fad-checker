/**
 * An imported BOM's <properties> must NOT leak into the importing project.
 *
 * Maven's `<scope>import</scope>` imports a BOM's **<dependencyManagement>**, and nothing
 * else. The BOM resolves its own managed versions in its own property context; its
 * `<properties>` never become the importing project's properties. fad merged them, and worse,
 * merged them so the BOM WON (`{...merged.properties, ...imported.properties}`), so a BOM
 * silently redefined the importer's own property values.
 *
 * Real-world shape, from Apache Dubbo 2.7.8: the reactor root sets
 * `<hibernate_validator_version>5.2.4.Final</hibernate_validator_version>`, and
 * `dubbo-dependencies-bom` — imported into the root's <dependencyManagement> — redefines it to
 * `5.4.1.Final`. `dubbo-filter-validation` declares
 * `<version>${hibernate_validator_version}</version>`, so it resolved to 5.4.1.Final instead
 * of the 5.2.4.Final Maven gives it. Verified against `mvn dependency:tree`, which reports
 * `org.hibernate:hibernate-validator:jar:5.2.4.Final:test` for that module.
 *
 * The wrong version means the wrong CVE set: it was the last remaining gap in
 * docs/BENCHMARK.md (4 findings of 657).
 *
 * The fixture is that shape, minimised, and it guards BOTH directions — the leak must stop,
 * and importing a BOM must still work.
