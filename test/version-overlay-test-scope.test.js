/**
 * The per-module overlay must recover TEST-scope masked versions too.
 *
 * The global transitive pass dedupes by `g:a` across the WHOLE reactor: one version wins and
 * every other version of that coord disappears. The overlay exists precisely to recover the
 * ones a different module really holds — but it hardcoded
 * `includedScopes: ["compile","runtime","provided"]`, so a version reachable only through a
 * test-scoped dependency could never be recovered. Maven says `test → compile = test`: those
 * versions ARE on that module's test classpath.
 *
 * Measured on Apache Dubbo 2.7.8, this single gap accounted for **all 78** findings
 * OSV-Scanner reported that fad missed — `jackson-databind:2.8.4:test` in
 * dubbo-registry-sofa, `hibernate-validator:5.2.4.Final:test` in dubbo-filter-validation,
 * `okhttp:3.11.0:test` in dubbo-configcenter-apollo, `commons-compress:1.18:test` in
 * dubbo-remoting-etcd3. Each verified against `mvn dependency:tree`.
 *
 * The fixture is that shape, minimised: module-a pulls the safe app:2.0.0 at compile scope
 * (so the global pass resolves com.acme:lib to 2.0.0), module-b pulls a test-only harness
 * that drags the vulnerable lib:1.0.0 onto its TEST classpath.
 *
 * The recovered version must be reported as **dev**, never production: it is on a test
 * classpath only, and letting it inflate the production count (or trip `--fail-on`) trades
 * one class of wrong answer for another.
