# Contributing

Thanks for looking. This is a young single-maintainer project, so the most valuable
contribution isn't necessarily code — it's **telling me where the output is wrong**.

## The most useful thing you can do

Run it on a real project and report what it got wrong:

```bash
npx fad-checker -s ./your-project
```

A [false positive / false negative report](https://github.com/9pings/fad-checker/issues/new?template=false_positive.yml)
with the coordinate and the manifest snippet that produced it is worth more than a feature
request. Dependency resolution has a long tail of real-world shapes — inherited BOMs, profile
matrices, `replace` directives, vendored jars — and the only way to cover them is to be shown
one that breaks.

## Development setup

Node ≥ 20, no other tooling required.

```bash
npm install
npm test                      # 606 tests via node --test
node --test test/core.test.js # a single file
node fad-checker.js -s test/fixtures/monorepo-mixed --offline --no-report
```

Building the single-file binaries needs [bun](https://bun.sh): `npm run build`.

## Ground rules for changes

- **Tests must not touch the network.** Every fixture-driven test drives an in-memory
  registry/fetcher. `test/offline-guarantee.test.js` is a tripwire that fails if any code path
  reaches for the network under `--offline` — don't work around it.
- **Add a fixture, not just an assertion.** New parsing behaviour belongs in
  `test/fixtures/`, next to the shapes that already live there.
- **A parse failure must never kill the run.** One malformed manifest logs a warning and the
  scan continues; there is no `process.exit(1)` mid-pipeline.
- **New ecosystem = new codec.** Implement the interface in
  `lib/codecs/codec.interface.js`, register it, and the orchestrator needs no edits. See
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`fix(maven): …`, `feat(gradle): …`).
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) is the code-level orientation map — conventions, invariants and the
  reasoning behind the non-obvious ones. Read it before a non-trivial change; it will save you
  from "simplifying" something that's load-bearing.

## On AI-assisted development

This codebase is written with heavy use of Claude Code, and I'm not going to pretend
otherwise — `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root is exactly what it looks like. What I ask of my own
changes and of contributions is the same either way: a test that fails before and passes
after, a fixture derived from a real-world shape, and no claim in the docs that isn't backed
by something you can run. If you find a place where the code doesn't meet that bar, that's a
bug report I want.
