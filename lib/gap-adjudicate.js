/**
 * lib/gap-adjudicate.js — adjudicate a claimed false negative against the public record.
 *
 * Context. A comparative benchmark produces pairs another scanner found and fad-checker
 * did not. It is tempting to treat that list as a recall backlog and start widening the
 * matcher until it shrinks. That is how a scanner acquires mass false positives, because
 * a claimed miss is only a real miss when the public record actually binds that
 * vulnerability to that coordinate AND that version.
 *
 * This module answers, per pair, which of those it is — using the SAME range evaluation
 * the scanner itself uses (`lib/osv-db`.vulnAffectsVersion), so a verdict of
 * CONFIRMED_MISS means "fad had the data and still didn't report it", never "the two
 * implementations disagree".
 *
 * It is pure: callers fetch the OSV record (see `scripts/adjudicate-gap.js`) and pass it
 * in. No fixture database ships with it — the authority is OSV at the time you ask.
 *
 * A note on OSV semantics, because misreading it is the specific error this guards:
 * `affected[].versions` is the list of **affected** versions, NOT the versions that carry
 * the fix. `{introduced: 1.2.12, fixed: 1.2.13}` means 1.2.12 is vulnerable and anything
 * below it is not. Reading that list as "fixed in" inverts every verdict.
