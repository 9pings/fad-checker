/**
 * lib/private-deps.js — "this coordinate exists in no registry we asked", for every
 * ecosystem that has a registry.
 *
 * Maven has had this since the beginning: a coordinate absent from every configured
 * repository is an internal artifact, and chapter 0 names it so the hole in the coverage is
 * reported rather than silent. Nothing equivalent existed for npm, PyPI, NuGet, Composer,
 * Go or RubyGems — an in-house `@acme/*` package simply returned no findings and looked
 * clean, which is the exact failure mode the Maven warning exists to prevent.
 *
 * The signal was already on the wire: those codecs query their registry for deprecation and
 * outdated data, and a 404 came back every time. It was collapsed into an error string and
 * dropped. So this adds no requests — it reads what the existing pass already learned.
 *
 * The distinction that matters, and the reason this is a module rather than a regex at the
 * call site: only a DEFINITIVE answer counts. A 404 (or 410) from every base means absent.
 * A timeout, a 5xx, a refused connection or an auth failure means UNKNOWN — the registry
 * did not say the package is missing, it failed to answer. Reporting those as private would
 * accuse a client of shipping internal packages because their proxy was flaky, which is
 * worse than saying nothing.
