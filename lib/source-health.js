/**
 * lib/source-health.js — is this report complete, and if not, which source went dark?
 *
 * An audit tool's worst output is a scan that ran to completion with a quiet hole in it.
 * `lib/maven-repo.js` already reasons this way for mirrors ("dropping Central would
 * silently turn a transient blip into a coverage hole"), but only Maven mirrors were
 * covered and nothing was ever reported. This generalises it to every remote source.
 *
 * The rule, ONLINE only:
 *   - a lookup served from the warm cache issues no request, so a source whose cache
 *     covers everything is silent even if the site is down. That is full coverage.
 *   - a request that gets no usable answer after the retry schedule is a hole. The run
 *     stops before writing anything, naming the domain, the codes, the failing URL and
 *     the flag that disables that source.
 * `--offline` never aborts: that mode's contract is already "warm cache only".
 *
 * The retry schedule applies ONLY to single-endpoint sources. A request carrying an
 * AbortSignal comes from a caller with its own deadline and its own failover across
 * mirrors/registries, so it is passed straight through.
 *
 * A definitive 404/410 is an ANSWER, not an outage — it is precisely how private and
 * internal packages are detected (lib/private-deps.js). Only 403/429/5xx and transport
 * failures count against a host.
