/**
 * lib/attribution.js — attribute each MATCH to the manifest/module that actually
 * resolves the version it was matched on.
 *
 * A depRecord is COORD-WIDE: the collectors merge every occurrence of a g:a across the
 * whole scan root into ONE record, so `versions[]` and `manifestPaths[]` are both
 * coord-wide sets with no link between them, and `scope` is a single merged value. A
 * MATCH, by contrast, carries exactly ONE version (matchOne clones the record per
 * version). Left alone that clone inherits the coord-wide manifest list and the merged
 * scope — so every version is reported against every manifest holding the coord.
 *
 * Invisible on a single reactor; wrong on the real-world shape fad is pointed at: an
 * audit root holding SEVERAL INDEPENDENT projects (each pom with its own external
 * parent, no shared reactor). Project A pins jackson-databind 2.15.3, project B pins
 * 2.17.0 → both projects get reported as holding BOTH versions, and each version's CVEs
 * land on both. Same class of error for a version the per-module overlay recovered: it
 * is a TRANSITIVE of one module, not the direct declaration the record describes —
 * unattributed it tops the exec summary's "direct production dependencies" pointing at
 * the very pom that pins the fixed version.
 *
 * Two provenance sources, checked per match:
 *   - `maskedVersions[]` (lib/version-overlay) — the version is a transitive of ONE
 *     module: re-stamp scope/via/depth and file it under that module.
 *   - `versionPaths{}` (lib/dep-record, maintained by the collectors) — the version is
 *     DECLARED in a known subset of manifests: narrow the match to that subset.
 * A version with neither (e.g. a global-pass transitive) is left untouched.
 *
 * Runs ONCE, after every match source is merged (CVE index, OSV, snyk) and before
 * anything reads scope/paths (exec summary, charts, chapters, exports, gate).
 * Pure w.r.t. the scan set: replaces `m.dep` with a clone, never mutating the shared
 * record — other matches still reference it.
