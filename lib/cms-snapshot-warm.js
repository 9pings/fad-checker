/**
 * lib/cms-snapshot-warm.js — phase-2 (online) warming of the per-publisher CMS advisory
 * snapshots an air-gapped phase 3 consumes automatically (runner.js offline fallback).
 *
 * `--import-anonymized` scans the descriptor's public coordinates with no source tree,
 * so the application plugins never run there and the CMS advisory lanes would reach
 * phase 3 with nothing cached. But the Drupal feed is keyed by package identity and
 * the PrestaShop/TYPO3 feeds are whole-repository: the descriptor's own coordinates are
 * enough to fetch them, so the documented 3-phase workflow needs no extra flags — warm
 * here, `--export-cache` carries the file, phase 3 reuses it offline. A fetched snapshot
 * is validated with its provider's schema before being written, so a shape change fails
 * online (where it can be fixed) instead of aborting the air-gapped phase 3.
 *
 * WordPress checksums are deliberately NOT warmed here: the reference is pinned by core
 * version and locale, which no descriptor carries (a WordPress core is not a package-
 * manager dependency) — it comes from an online scan of the tree or `--wp-checksums`.
 *
 * Pure: takes deps + fetchImpl → writes snapshot files. No I/O beyond those files.
