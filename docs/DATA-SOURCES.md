# Data sources & acknowledgments

`fad-checker` is glue around several outstanding public datasets. Each is used per its license terms.

Persistent caches (`~/.fad-checker/`) mean each source is hit at most once per its TTL (full
table → [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md)). **No telemetry, no third-party analytics** — every request
above targets the named endpoint, optionally through the configured shared proxy with a `User-Agent: fad-checker-*` header, and
`--offline` makes none at all.

Application inventory reads local files. Configured PrestaShop and TYPO3 advisory
lanes also query the GitHub repository feeds listed above. SPIP core advisories use
NVD's product query (`virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:a:spip:spip`), routed through the
shared proxy when configured. Joomla and Magento source-only components retain
unqualified publisher coverage; this implementation has no dedicated publisher
advisory lane for them. Public Composer dependencies still use OSV/Packagist. Adobe Commerce
packages distributed through `repo.magento.com` are excluded from Packagist audit
and its public package metadata lookup;
an omitted Packagist response is reported as unknown advisory coverage for that package;
it is never cached or treated as a clean advisory result.
